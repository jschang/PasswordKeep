Here's a little password manager I put together.  I had originally intended it for exclusively personal use.

Not that it's really worth stamping a license on, but I'm going to anyways.

Everything except the "cryptastic" class is LGPLv3.  The "cryptastic" class was written by Andrew Johnson and I got it off a site mentioned in the PhpDoc.

See COPYING and COPYING.LESSER for licensing details on the rest of the code.
